        "solution": "The average kinetic energy of particles in a substance is determined by both their mass and speed. The formula for the average kinetic energy is KE = 0.5 * m * v\u00b2, where m is the mass and v is the velocity of the particles. In this scenario, both samples have the same average speed (1,300 m/s). However, the mass of each particle in Sample B (44 u) is greater than the mass of each particle in Sample A (28 u). Since the speed is the same for both samples, the sample with the greater particle mass will have a higher average kinetic energy. Thus, Sample B, with its heavier particles, has a higher average kinetic energy than Sample A. Consequently, the temperature, which correlates with average kinetic energy, is higher for Sample B.",

        "lecture": "Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.\nIn a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re\u00adacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.",
        "solution": "Step 1: Think about each change.\nCompost forms from the remains of plants and animals, such as vegetable scraps and egg shells. Compost rotting is a chemical change. As the compost rots, it breaks down and turns into a different type of matter.\nA piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.\nIf you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling.",

The role of pollen is essential in the process of pollination, where it is transferred to the female part of the flower.

This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a woolly fleece. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a hairy fleece.",

The allele B is dominant for a hairy body, so any genotype containing at least one B allele (BB or Bb) will result in a hairy phenotype. All four boxes show either BB or Bb, meaning all offspring will have the phenotype of a hairy body. None of the squares show bb, which would indicate a hairless body. Thus, the expected ratio of hairy to hairless offspring is determined by the number of boxes with genotypes BB or Bb versus those with bb.",

        "solution": "The map highlights a large area in dark green located on the eastern coast. Historically, Virginia was one of the original 13 colonies and included regions that are now part of West Virginia.

Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene.

The question tells you that the F allele, which is for smooth fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for fuzzy fruit.\nSmooth fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit texture trait.

The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.\n | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand\nSupply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up\nSupply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down\nProducers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.",

        "lecture": "Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.\nLines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0\u00b0 latitude. We start counting degrees from there.\nLines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.\nLines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0\u00b0 longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.\nThe equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180\u00b0E and 180\u00b0W.\nTogether, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place.",

Identify what each has that the other wants:\n   - Kayla wants broccoli but does not have tomatoes or hot dogs.\n   - Janet wants tomatoes but does not have broccoli or sandwiches.\n\n2. Based on the present information, a feasible trade between them is:\n   - If Janet had broccoli (not listed in the wants but considered in humor for the problem logic), she could give that to Kayla.\n   - If Kayla had tomatoes (also not listed in the wants but a humorous consideration), she could give them to Janet.\n\n3. Properly, the image logic suggests a humorous fix where:\n   - Janet can get tomatoes by trading, which humorously assumes a stock solution of:  \n   Janet trades broccoli for tomatoes with Kayla, knowing both need what's being humorously assumed for each.\n  \n4. This fulfills all the needs based on the classic humorous route of \u201cstock\u201d answer solutions.",

The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.\nWhat happens if the amount of matter changes?

In this experiment, you would like to know if some plants grow taller than others. So, you must be able to compare the plants' heights. To do this, you can observe which plants are taller by looking at them, or you can measure their exact heights with a meterstick.\nSo, if you have different types of soil and can observe or measure the heights of your plants, then you have the supplies you need to investigate your question with an experiment!",

In Pair 1, there is a larger disk magnet on the left and a smaller rectangular magnet on the right, both aligned with opposite poles facing each other. In Pair 2, there is a rectangular magnet on the left and a smaller disk magnet on the right, also with opposite poles facing each other. Both disk magnets are larger than the rectangular magnets.",
        "solution": "The magnitude of the magnetic force is influenced by the size of the magnets, with larger magnets generally producing a greater force. In each pair, the magnets are of the same material and are aligned for attraction (opposite poles facing each other). Pair 1 features a larger disk magnet and a larger rectangular magnet compared to the smaller magnets in Pair 2. Although Pair 2 also has a disk and a rectangular magnet, both are smaller in size than those in Pair 1. Given that the sizes in Pair 2 are smaller, the magnitude of the magnetic force will also be smaller in Pair 2 compared to Pair 1.",

When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.\nIn a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating.

For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.\nHumans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.\nA mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.\nA pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!",

An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles.

Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene.

        "solution": "To determine which organism contains matter once part of the bilberry, examine the arrows starting from the bilberry. The bilberry has arrows pointing towards the Arctic fox and bear sedge. The Arctic fox arrow also points to the collared lemming, but none of these pathways connect directly or indirectly to the collared lemming. There is no arrow from the bilberry towards the collared lemming, indicating matter does not pass from bilberry to the collared lemming. As for the grizzly bear, the arrows show that it receives matter from the barren-ground caribou and Arctic fox, but these do not connect from the bilberry either. However, the Arctic fox does indirectly connect to the bear through different organisms. Therefore, the only pathway potentially leading matter from the bilberry to the grizzly bear is not established in the given food web.",

        "solution": "Flowers have male and female reproductive parts. The male part produces pollen, and the female part produces eggs. Pollination occurs when pollen is transferred to the female part. Post-pollination, sperm from the pollen mixes with the eggs, leading to fertilization. Fertilized eggs develop into seeds. Based on this process, pollen primarily functions to aid in seed production, as it plays a crucial role in fertilization. According to the standard answer, pollen helps make seeds by facilitating fertilization. It is not involved in increasing plant size or leaf development.",

The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating.

An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.",

Both ceramic and glass objects are known to be fragile, meaning they can shatter or break if dropped. An icicle, though made of ice, can also break easily if it falls or is struck.\n- \"Salty\" also pertains to taste, which is irrelevant to the objects in question as a mug, bowl, flask, and icicle do not inherently possess a salty flavor.\nSince the only property applicable to all four objects is their susceptibility to breaking, they are best described by the term \"fragile.\"",

In each of 12 containers, she placed six leaf squares: three tomato-leaf squares and three broccoli-leaf squares. She put one slug from her garden into each container. After two days, Lola measured the amount of each leaf square that had been eaten by the slugs. She compared the amount that had been eaten from the tomato-leaf squares to the amount that had been eaten from the broccoli-leaf squares.\nFigure: a slug on a leaf.",

Lola measured the amount eaten from each type of leaf square after two days. This indicates she is comparing the quantity consumed from each type.\n\nNow, I'll determine which of the choices reflects testing feeding preference and measuring the amount eaten.

But over time, the filter would become clogged with bacteria. If the filter became clogged, the water would not move through quickly enough.

The violet sabrewing also has a long, thin beak designed for reaching nectar deep in flowers, making it similar to the rufous hummingbird in this aspect. On the other hand, the common shelduck has a wide, flat beak, suited for eating plants and invertebrates in mud, making it dissimilar in adaptation.

Each pair has two magnets arranged with their respective poles labeled 'N' for North and 'S' for South. In Pair 1, the N pole of one magnet is close to the S pole of the other magnet. In Pair 2, the S pole of one magnet is close to the N pole of the other magnet. The distance between the magnets in both pairs is the same, labeled as 2 inches.",
        "solution": "Magnetic force depends on the strength of the magnets and the distance between them. When opposite poles are facing each other (N to S), the magnets attract each other. Since the distance between the magnets in both pairs is the same, and the material of the magnets is consistent, the strength of the magnetic force will solely depend on the orientation. In both pairs, the opposite poles are facing each other, leading to an attractive force. Therefore, despite the change in sequence, the magnetic force's magnitude remains unaffected because the orientation from N to S in both cases is an attraction, resulting in equal magnetic forces.",

        "solution": "The kinetic energy of a particle is calculated using the formula \\( KE = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2 \\), where \\( m \\) is the mass and \\( v \\) is the velocity of the particle. For temperature comparison, focus on the average kinetic energy, which is primarily influenced by the mass and speed of particles.\n\nIn Sample A, each particle has a mass of 44 u and an average speed of 1,200 m/s. In Sample B, each particle has a mass of 40 u and an average speed of 1,100 m/s. Kinetic energy is directly proportional to both the mass and the square of the speed.\n\n1. The particles in Sample A have more mass (44 u) than those in Sample B (40 u).\n2. The average speed of particles in Sample A (1,200 m/s) is also greater than that in Sample B (1,100 m/s).\n\nBoth higher mass and greater speed contribute to higher kinetic energy. Therefore, Sample A, with both greater mass and speed, will have a higher average kinetic energy compared to Sample B.

For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating.

In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.\nImagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.\nThen, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.\nExperiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.\nExamples of questions that this experiment can answer include:\nDoes soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?\nDo daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?\nAre daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?",

How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.\nIn a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same.

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nLeroy, a materials engineer, was developing a quick-drying fabric for athletic clothing. The fabric needed to absorb one drop of water in less than one second and dry completely in less than five minutes. Leroy thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use.\nSo, he made a sample fabric that was 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Then he put one drop of water on the sample. He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed.\nFigure: fabric that has not absorbed drops of water.",

How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.",

        "lecture": "Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.",
